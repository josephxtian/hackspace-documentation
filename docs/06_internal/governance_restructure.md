# Governance Restructure

## Summary of What's Happening and Why
Manchester Hackspace has changed a lot since its inception in 2009. Our management needs have changed massively since then, and we're evolving our governance structure to better reflect the modern needs of our organisation and community. Up to this point, the board of directors have been the day to day running force of Hackspace, supported by a revolving group of volunteers and helpers. We've loved seeing Hackspace grow, however the size of our community now makes it unfeasible for a small group of volunteer directors (who have full-time jobs as well) to take the sole responsibility for everything.

Under the new system, the board of directors will switch to a strategic non-executive role, focusing on the long-term sustainability and legal compliance of the space.
To keep things running smoothly day to day, we are introducing a **management committee** of five members. The committee will lead the core functions of the space, ensuring decisions can be made faster and tasks don't fall through the cracks.

The area coordinator role will be changed to **Team Leaders**. These leaders will head up collaborative teams of volunteers for each workshop. Ensuring regular workshop meetings take place and making it easier for everyone to contribute.

We hope a tiered organisation structure will empower more members to get involved with the space. Providing a clearer route for members to get involved, and take on more responsibility incrementally, whilst learning how our processes work.

For the avoidance of doubt, all roles listed here are voluntary and will not be paid.

## Board of Directors
The directors will oversee Hackspace as a whole, ensuring legal compliance, financial sustainability, and ensuring the organisation achieves its stated aims. The directors will provide support and advice to the committee, as well as ensuring training is available to cover any knowledge gaps in the organisation. The directors will delegate spending budgets to the committee to achieve set goals.

It is intended that a role on the board of directors is a long term commitment, similar to a governor or board of trustees position, ensuring the organisation does not suffer from loss of hard-earned knowledge as other roles as passed on. 

The directors will retain the legal liability for the Manchester Makers Ltd (the legal entity that is Manchester Hackspace), and will thus retain the final decision on any contested matter.

## Committee Role Descriptions

Committee members will be responsible for ensuring the delivery of the tasks assigned to their roles. The committee will manage spending budgets agreed with the directors. You are welcome to list the experience you gain on job applications, and the directors can provide references if needed.

## Workshop Teams

### Team Leaders
Team leaders act as an easy point of contact for the commitee and members for a workshop area. They facilitate area meetings, coordinate projects in workshops, and ensure there are enough volunteers involved to keep the workshop open.

### Teams
Teams are made up of members active in an area.
Any member of a team can add a qualifying member to a team. If you are consistantly helping out and improving an area, the team cannot block you becoming a part of it.
The board can add and remove members from teams.

#### Team Meetings
At each meeting, the team should:
- Confirm the list of current team members.
- Discuss proposed purchases and consumable restocks.
- Discuss any upgrade plans for the area.
- Discuss training and maintenance needs for their area.

Meetings should be open to members, though at busy meetings speaking may be limited to team members only.
