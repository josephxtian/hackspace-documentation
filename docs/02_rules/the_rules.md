# Rules of Membership
All members are bound by these rules as a condition of membership.

**Hackspace Manchester is something we do together. It is a community.** The infrastructure (building, equipment, internet etc) provides the foundations, and we all take joint responsibility for the rest. 

The following rules lay out the minimum expectations from all Hackspace Members.

## Rule 1 - Be Excellent to Each Other

Treat one another with respect. This is an inclusive environment, and we will not tolerate any behaviour that we deem to be harassment, bullying, or discrimination.

Further information - [Conduct & Complaints Policy](./conduct_complaints.md)

## Rule 2 - Keep Hackspace Tidy

Put tools back in the same condition you found them, dispose of items appropriately and leave your workspace tidy. E.g. Give the floor a sweep, empty the vacuum cleaners and take out the bins.

## Rule 3 - Respect the Space

There are few places quite like Manchester Hackspace. We operate on trust and honesty and we do not tolerate those who abuse this.

Please share the space and tools with others, your needs do not take priority over anyone else's.

Use consumables sparingly, providing your own or replenishing the space’s stock where you are likely to use a lot (see our ).

Things occassionally break and that's ok. Please report it and volunteer to attempt a fix if you are able or organise a replacement (Hackspace will cover the cost).

Further information - [Fair Use Policy](./fair_use_policy.md)

## Rule 4 - Give Back to the Space

The space is run, maintained and improved by all of us. We are not a commodity or service provider. Give back however you can: cleaning, joining a team, upgrading the space, etc. Make time on every visit to do a few chores.

If you see something broken, report it, don't just shove it back in a cupboard.

## Rule 5 - Do Not Hack or Borrow

No tools or items should be taken, borrowed or loaned from the space. We do not provide a ‘tool library’ service.  
Anything labelled do not hack should not be altered or taken apart.  
Do not interfere with our infrastructure unless you have the permission of the board of directors.

## Rule 6 - Supervise your Guests & Pets

Members are permitted to bring guests with them. Guests must not use induction protected equipment, should be closely supervised and should not disrupt other members. Members are wholly responsible for the actions of their guests. Any member can request someone else's guest or pet leave if they are causing a nuisance.
Under-18s are allowed in the space when accompanied by a member.

!!! warning
    The space is full of things that could be hazardous to an animal if ingested or stood on. Please consider this before bringing in your pet.

## Rule 7 - Be Safe

We foster a culture of safety at Manchester Hackspace and must look out for each other. If you see something unsafe happening, stop it as soon as practical. If possible create an opportunity for learning and development.

Make sure you are confident you know how to use a tool before using it.
If in doubt read the manual, ask another member or use the internet to learn. Some tools require an induction before you are able to use them, check on the [membership portal]({{ links.members_portal }}/equipment).

Wearing personal protective equipment and informing others around you (if necessary) is your responsibility. Hackspace provides a range of PPE. Use it and contact the board if the stock is running low.

## Rule 8 - Be Legal

Follow the rule of UK law when in the space. Alcohol is not permitted when using tools or equipment. Do not make or bring in weapons or controlled substances.

## Rule 9 - Store Your Stuff or Take It Home

The space provides limited storage for active projects. Everything must be labelled.
If a project becomes inactive please remove it from the space. Do not leave projects in workshop areas.

The Hackspace reserves the right to remove, dispose, donate or repurpose anything not stored inline with our guidelines. You may be charged for the removal and disposal of abandoned items.

## Rule 10 - Donate Intelligently

Removing ‘donated’ items from the space diverts volunteer efforts, and has cost us a considerable amount in disposal fees. Consider how useful something is to others before you offer it to the space and ask on the forum in advance. If you're getting rid of something because it doesn't work quite right, chances are we don't want it either.

Do not leave E-waste in the space. Your old Windows Vista desktop, screen with burnt out pixels and bag full of used vapes you don't want in your house are no exception.

We do accept quality tool donations, and other equipment that might withstand the regular use our members will give it. Please either post to the [forum]({{ links.forum }}/) or contact the directors directly on <board@hacman.org.uk>.
