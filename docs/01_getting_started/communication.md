# Communications

Manchester Hackspace is a busy community. We use a few different tools to stay organised.

## The Forum (Official)

*The go-to place for keeping up with the community*
Used for everything from showing off your latest project, to reporting a faulty piece of equipment. Also used for admin announcements, posting events, maintenance updates, scheduling inductions and purchase proposals.

## Telegram (Less official)
[t.me/hacmanchester](https://t.me/hacmanchester)

Informal and quick moving discussion such as ‘where do we keep screws’ or chatting about an idea you're developing. Telegram is a messaging app similar to Whatsapp. The conversation is split into several topics.

**Please do not feel like you need to keep up with chats, all official communications are by forum or email.**


## Instagram

We're on instagram, feel free to tag us. We'd love more content on our instagram, so if you have anything to show off, please send it our way!

## Newsletter
Our monthly newsletter is a handy summary of upcoming events at the space and the most important announcements.

You can unsubscribe at any time via the `Edit` button on your page of the [members portal](https://members.hacman.org.uk).

## Email
Occasionally the board of directors may need to email you directly. You may receive emails from <info@hacman.org.uk> or <board@hacman.org.uk>. These are usually important updates, please do not ignore these.

## Calendar

Our Google Calendar is kept up to date with all the events happening in any month. It also features a handy Etihad match day reminder so you don't get caught out by the football traffic.
