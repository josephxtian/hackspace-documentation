# Introduction
Hackspace Manchester is a space for people who enjoy making things and being involved in a community.

We are a workshop run entirely by our own community, and by joining us you're making a commitment to giving your time and contributing your knowledge to keep Hackspace safe, open and enjoyable. We have a diverse community of over 350 members from all walks of life and with all sorts of skills. We have processes, guidelines and rules to keep things running smoothly for everyone.

Please take time to read through our docs, and familiarise yourself with how we run.

## What is Hackspace?
Hackspace is a thing we do together. It’s a makerspace run by its community for its community.

Manchester Hackspace is just one of many spaces in the UK. Each space is run independently by its members. The aim of hackspace is to provide members with the tools and space they need to get making, and a supportive community to do it in.

It is important everyone understands:
- Hackspace is run entirely by volunteers (including the directors) and people helping out where they can. A lot of us have full time jobs, and do what we can after work. You may not recieve speedy responses to your questions (though we do try), and sometimes things don't get fixed as quickly as we'd like.
- We are not a business, providing you perfect workshops in return for money and you are not a paying customer expecting a 5* service.
- We do not promise any tools will be available. If something is broken, ask 'is there anything I can do to help fix it?' instead of 'when will it be fixed?'.
- If members don't help out, everything crumbles.
- At the very very least, tidy up after yourself, report what you break, and help restock consumables you see running low when you pop to hardware shops.
- The directors put their trust in each and every member to act with integrity and safely when in the space. If you see someone being dangerous, call it out. People taking unneccessary risks put everything we have on the line.

## What is at Hackspace?
