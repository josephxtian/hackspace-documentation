# Waste Disposal

Waste disposal is managed by our Landlord. Bins are provided for the disposal of domestic waste only. If a bin is getting full please empty it into the building bins and replace the bin bag.

There are a few large cuboid disposal delivery bags around the space. These have been provided by members for members who are willing to take a bag and empty it at the tip every so often.

The space does not provide the facilities to dispose of metal or wood and gets fined if these are put in the bins. The only exception to this is bagged sawdust. Please take your offcuts home with you.

## Bin Store Location
To get to the bins, leave through the front door and turn left. Take a left down the driveway, and there is a door halfway down the building.

The bin store is secured with a code lock, the **passcode** can be found on a notice on the inside of our front doors.
