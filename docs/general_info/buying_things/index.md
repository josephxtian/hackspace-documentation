# Buying Things

We encourage members to get involved with upgrading the tools at hackspace, replacing broken tools, and buying consumables. All permitted spending can be reimbursed, so you won't be out of pocket for helping out. Read on to learn what permitted spending covers.

Our spending systems can be divided into three categories:

1. Consumables - Items that degrade through the nature of their use or are disposible. This includes glues, screws, disposible gloves, blades, paper products, electronic components (resistors, etc.), cleaning equipment, oils, etc.
2. Purchase Proposals - Most other spending in the space. This could include a new hand tool, some new shelves, or a new machine.
3. Project Spending - Members forming a tean with a stated goal, and asking for a pre-approved budget to achieve that goal, e.g. 'To create a metal fabrication area, including facilities for MIG welding, grinding and finishing steel projects.

### Reimbursement

Fill in the [reimbursement form]({{ links.reimbursement }}), providing your proof of purchase (receipt, paid invoice, etc.) within 90 days of the proposal being approved.
You can expect reimbursement within 30 days of submission.

If the cost of the purchase is prohibitive for you to purchase yourself and reclaim, please make a request for purchase to <purchasing@hacman.org.uk>, sending a link to the item, and your details for the delivery, or in the case of multiple items, an itemised invoice for payment by bank transfer.

All reimbursement requests will be validated before payment. Please ensure the information submitted provides sufficient detail to verify the spending is legitimate.

### Delivery

Members will need to organise delivery themselves as Hackspace is not staffed and does not have a building conceirge. This could either be by booking the delivery on a day you know you will be at the space, ordering delivery to your home address or arranging with another member for them to accept the delivery.
