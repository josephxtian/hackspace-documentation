# Consumables

We aim to maintain a stock of useful consumables for members to use. Approved cosumables are on the [consumables list]({{ links.consumables_list }}), along with the pre-approved cost, permitted purchase level and recommended supplier.

The consumables list is intended for small and frequent replenishment of our stock. If we need a significant restock of a consumable (in either quantity or cost) please email <purchasing@hacman.org.uk> before purchasing.

#### Purchase Levels
Consumables are assigned a 'Permitted Approver'. So long as you have the required approval, anyone can be the person to buy the consumable.
- None Needed - Any member can buy and expense this consumable.
- Area Coordinator - You must have the area coordinator or board's authorisation to expense this consumable.
- Board - Only the board of directors can approve this expense.

#### The Price Has Gone Up?
Prices listed include VAT, and we permit up to 20% overspend on the pre-approved price to account for variations in price over time or amortisation of additional costs, such as delivery fees. Let us know if our prices are out of date <purchasing@hacman.org.uk>.

### Adding More to the List

Consumables can be added to the list with support of the board OR by simple majority vote at a members meeting. Apply via the [forum mega thread]({{ links.consumables_mega_thread }}).

Items can be later withdrawn from the list by majority vote at members meeting or at the board's discretion.
