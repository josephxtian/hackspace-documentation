# Project Budgets

Project budgets encourage members to get together to improve Hackspace and make ideas a reality.

1. Come up with an idea that improves Hackspace, be it the physical space or the community.
2. Form a team of members who are keen to make it happen.
3. Write up a proposal to the forum using the purchase proposal form template.

The key difference between project budgets and a purchase proposal, is that the budget can be slightly more losely defined. The board will judge the project by similar criteria to a purchase proposal. A key consideration before approval is granted will be whether we believe the stated budget is feasible, and realistic, and whether we believe there is sufficient commitment to see the idea through the completion.

### Support
Member support must be gained like any other proposal. As project budgets are relatively new, the board may waive the need for a members meeting if there is clear support to make something happen, and no opposition to the idea.

### Examples
A couple of examples of project proposals could be:
- Creating a screenprinting set up at Hackspace (this happened!).
- Building a photographic dark room in the space.
- Launching a makers talks event, where some budget is needed to get interesting people to Manchester to speak at the event.
- Buying and installing a big 2nd hand laser cutter where it is difficult to specify exactly what might be needed to fix it up and install it (this also happened).
- Starting a model railway night, and wanting some funds to build a layout in Hackspace.
