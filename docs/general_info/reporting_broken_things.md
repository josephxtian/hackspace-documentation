# Reporting Broken Things

**Things break, and that's ok! The most important thing you can do is [report it]({{ links.broken_equipment_form }}).**

We don't have teams of people checking over our tools everyday. If you try to use a tool, and it gets broken, or doesn't work, please mark it out of order and report it. It will *never* get fixed otherwise, and is immensely frustrating to others who come to use a tool only to find it broken and unreported.

You will not be charged for breaking a tool (with the extremely rare exception where we believe you to have been grossly negligent and acting with intent to cause damage), so please do not hide it back in a cupboard.

!!! tip
    If a consumable breaks, and it's never going to work again, please throw it away. Draws full of blunt drill bits, ripped sandpaper and snapped screws are no good to anyone.

## Reporting Process
You can report a tool as broken using our [incident report form]({{ links.broken_equipment_form }}).

### 1. Isolate It
Unplug it and make it safe. Clean the area around it if it's created a mess.

### 2. Report It
Fill in our [report form]({{ links.broken_equipment_form }}).

### 3. Mark It
Physically mark the tool out of order. A piece of paper stuck to it with a note is useful. What's broken, the date, and your name/initials are all helpful.

!!! tip "Fix It?"
    If you're competant with the tool and believe you can fix it, please let the area coordinator or a maintainer know before you attempt a fix. 

!!! failure "Do Not Bodge It!"
    We've had to write off machines before because members have shoved a wood screws into places they shouldn't go on a sewing machine. Sometimes your project will need to wait until it's fixed, and trying to continue will permanently break the machine, and your project.

## Can I Help?
This depends what tool it is and what's happened to it, but generally help is very much appreciated.

### Low Cost Tools
If it's a low cost/disposible tool (e.g. a powertool that is glued together with no replaceable parts), it's very likely we'll need to buy a new one. This can be done through a [purchase proposal](./buying_things/index.md) on the forum. We don't have to buy the same thing either, if you think we should buy a different model/an upgrade, you're welcome to propose that instead.

### Bigger Machines
If it's something bigger/more expensive/with replaceable parts, it would be great if you could have a look at what you think might need ordering to fix it. Our [micro purchase proposal](./buying_things/purchase_proposals.md) is designed for this sort of thing.

We'd love it if you'd like to become a maintainer of a tool, speak to an area coordinator or post to the forum if you don't know who to contact.

## This Tool Has Been Broken For Ages...
If a tool's been broken for ages, first, does it have a note on, and do you know it's been reported? If yes to both of those questions, the answer is probably that no one has volunteered to fix it.

Can you lend your skills, or spend some time learning to fix it properly? Get in touch with an area coordinator or post to the [forum]({{ links.forum }}/c/broken-tools-maintenance-logs/59) if you are willing to help.
