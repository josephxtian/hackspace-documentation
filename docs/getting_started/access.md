# Door Access

## Keyfob Access
Once your account is set up, you'll need to get a keyfob to access the space. You will need to register a keyfob. Fobs are available by the registration computer (in front of you when you enter the space).

To add an RFID tag to your account, log into the [membership portal]({{ links.members_portal }}) and click "Set up an access method" at the top of the page.

!!! info
    Your Fob Will Not Work until you have completed the induction and ticked the box at the bottom

Click on the text box under the `Add a keyfob` and scan your new fob on the reader connected to the sign up PC, this will auto-populate the text box, then click `Add a new fob` to save it.

!!! tip
    You can also use a compatible mobile phone to register a fob by simply using any 13.5mhz rfid tag, reading the id of that fob and entering it into the field below on the membership system

## Access Code
The space can also be accessed with an access code.

In the [membership portal]({{ links.members_portal }}), click on `Your Membership` and then `access methods` at the top of the page. 

Click on `Request access code` and your pincode will be displayed at the top of your profile when the page refreshes.

!!! info
    New members must register a fob before you are able to request an access code.

## Accessibility
The space has one small doorstep to get in, about 5cm high. We have a rubber wheelchair ramp that can be laid out quickly to assist wheeled entry, and a doorbell that can be used to bring someone to the door. Most of Hackspace is on one level, though the floor can be a little uneven in places. The Visual Arts area is on a raised platform with balustrades around all sides. The platform is accessed by a steep ramp to one side (1 in 3 gradient) and stairs to the other.

As a 24/7 community space we cannot be guaranteed the floor will be kept clear, however the space is large enough that blockages are unlikely to prohibit flow around the space.
