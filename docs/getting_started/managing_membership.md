# Managing Your Membership

Your membership is managed via the self-service [membership portal]({{ links.members_portal }}).
This is the same portal you used to sign up and set up your direct debit when you joined.

From the portal you can:
* Complete your online induction
* [Set up a key fob](access.md) (and pin access code)
* Amend your direct debit
* Cancel your membership
* Apply for tool inductions
* Keep your address up to date (legal requirement - see our [terms and conditions](../rules_policies/membership_t_and_cs.md)).

## Pausing Your Membership
Our membership fees are kept low as we base them on rolling subscriptions. Though we discourage it, if you need to pause your membership, this can be done in the same way as [cancelling your membership](#cancelling-your-membership). Your access to the space will be paused at the date of your next direct debit payment.

Your membership account and a record of all your inductions will remain until your account is deleted in line with our [privacy policy](../05_governance/legal_notices/privacy_notice.md). Depending on the length of pause, you may be asked to repeat inductions on tools, or repeat the open evening tour.

!!! warning
    Paused members do not benefit from use of project storage. Ensure you remove anything you have stored at the space.
    

## Cancelling Your Membership
Membership can be cancelled via the [membership portal]({{ links.members_portal }}). Scroll to the very bottom and click `Cancel Your Direct Debit and Leave`. Your access to the space will be revoked at the date of your next direct debit.

!!! warning
    Ensure you remove anything you have stored at Hackspace. Anything left will be considered abandoned in line with our [storage Ts & Cs](../rules_policies/member_storage.md). Hackspace reserves the right to charge you for the removal and disposal of anything left after your membership ceases.
