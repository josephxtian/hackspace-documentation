It\u2019s a makerspace run by its community for its community.</p> <p>Manchester Hackspace is just one of many spaces in the UK. Each space is run independently by its members. The aim of hackspace is to provide members with the tools and space they need to get making, and a supportive community to do it in.</p> <p>It is important everyone understands: - Hackspace is run entirely by volunteers (including the directors) and people helping out where they can. A lot of us have full time jobs, and do what we can after work. You may not recieve speedy responses to your questions (though we do try), and sometimes things don't get fixed as quickly as we'd like. - We are not a business, providing you perfect workshops in return for money and you are not a paying customer expecting a 5* service. - We do not promise any tools will be available. If something is broken, ask 'is there anything I can do to help fix it?' instead of 'when will it be fixed?'. - If members don't help out, everything crumbles. - At the very very least, tidy up after yourself, report what you break, and help restock consumables you see running low when you pop to hardware shops. - The directors put their trust in each and every member to act with integrity and safely when in the space. If you see someone being dangerous, call it out.

I attach details of what is proposed. It will considerably enhance the appearance of the property. \u00a0 Whilst your current lease doesn\u2019t expire until 30th April 2016 our client has asked us to enter into negotiations with you now for a new lease. We can confirm that our client is willing to grant you a new lease for a further period of three years from 1st May 2016 at the rent of \u00a39,750 plus VAT per annum. This works out at about \u00a310 per square foot which is the going rate for accommodation of this nature in the area. Your current is \u00a37,800 plus VAT per annum. \u00a0 It is also intended that folloing the refurbishment, the landlord will arrange for the cleaning of the communal areas on a regular basis. The cost of this will be recoverable via a service charge. The annual charge for your property will be an additional \u00a31,000 plus VAT per year. This will also include the costs of communal area electricity and fire alarm/emergency lighting testing and maintenance. This will be charged from the December quarter day. \u00a0 I would be happy to meet with you at the property to discuss the matter if you wish. \u00a0 I look forward to hearing from you. \u00a0 Regards, \u00a0 Ian</p> <p>TK - er\u2026 no</p> <p>KR - \u00a31200/49 = \u00a325 pw</p> <p>BC - It'd basically be \u00a31075 per month rent</p> <p>TK - Still no.

Owing to a misunderstanding / miscommunication between the board it was believed that the proposal was public knowledge. They have been informed that this was not the case and would like to apologise for this oversight.</p> <p>These changes had not been finalised and were still in development when an intended draft of the changes was published to the main telegram chat.</p> <p>As a result the board has discussed the changes and the following was agreed:   - The board sees the changes are necessary and beneficial to the space to ensure the storage situation is equitable for all members. Irrespective of any previous arrangement agreed by historic boards.   - The space has grown significantly in membership since the original rules were set a few years ago.  As such we cannot guarantee storage space at the same rate we gain new members.   - Member storage has become severely unbalanced in what type of storage members can get. It is disingenuous for any member to claim that the former arrangements were equitable. Where some people had larger spaces than others and these were limited. The current board does not support, and will work against, tiered systems of membership or the perception that any portion of the membership is treated differently to another.   - The Hackspace will no longer support or recommend a specific container type or brand, storage space will be governed by its dimensions, not what container it can hold.   - All member will be required to fit their method of storage within the new constraints.   - Member storage allowance will be subject to periodic review although we will try to keep any disruption to a minimum / infrequently.   - There will be a transition period to allow members to move over to the new storage system.  Afterwards members will need to adhere to large project storage if they cannot fit their stuff in their storage space.  The period allowed will be decided on at a later date.   - Going forward storage of member items will no longer be allowed in any of the project areas, there have been many instances where the workshop areas have become additional storage space blocking access to tools &amp; equipment.  Members must use either their allocated storage space or book an area of large project storage.   - An official statement / rational separate from the board minutes will likely follow in due course.</p> <p>The position of being a board member is voluntary and the responsibilities that come with the position can provide extra levels of stress that have been known to cause members to leave the space due to exhaustion.</p> <p>Covid has brought challenges to the hackspace and the board has tried to work through them to the best of our abilities.  We understand that members may not be happy with some of our decisions from time to time, however pointing out specific things a board member has said previously in a manner that focuses blame on said individual makes it personal and unwelcoming.  We\u2019d like to remind members that we do our best to make decisions in good faith, after all we are still members ourselves.</p> <p>We recognise that we still have some way to go with improving our transparency and communication to the membership. We want to do a good job for everyone\u2019s benefit and to that end it is important that we try and be considerate in our responses. It is worth pointing out that Telegram, by nature of it\u2019s real time and context switching, is not the place to expect well thought out and considered replies. Where a topic is of importance we would request that you please write on the forum or to the board via email. You\u2019re free to discuss what you want where you want but the board cannot take Telegram as an official line of communication to ourselves.</p>"},{"location":"governance/board_minutes/2021/2021-03-11/#covid-grants","title":"Covid Grants","text":"<ul> <li>The space has received more additional funding.</li> <li>The board are looking at ways to reduce our tax liability by pre-loading expected costs before the end of the financial year such as consumables or infrastructure spending.</li> <li>Expenditure will be on items the board sees necessary and will still require board approval as before.

Make the agenda less imposing and keep updates short. Get area updates more regularly. Option to also have separate meetings for specific large items.</p> <p>CCTV - happy to keep all new cameras internal, could consider having a few cameras in safe areas so members can use them to capture footage. Aware of potential blind spots.  The privacy policy will be updated on the forum (locked post) and website, we will offer feedback via email for a month's consultation period then email the final version to all members. JC has asked we don\u2019t engage with members about this on telegram or forum. Go ahead has been given to start buying internal cameras.</p> <p>Previous board minutes should be published and anonymised.</p> <p>Parking is a shitshow. Council either don\u2019t respond by email or phone for any issues we are having, HA has requested more permits but they could be already stolen from the mail room. JC suggested using Alan Good for parking woes.  Epermits should be redistributed to active members. HA said he would do a 6 month review anyway. We should put up a sign in the space for parking permits and make a distributor so people only take one.</p> <p>We should write up a mechanism for safety equipment that we can all agree on. Discretionary spending exists. We could maybe make a pot for safety equipment spending but also pointed out we would never reject anyone requesting valid safety equipment . We could empower area coordinators to buy equipment or members can request and area coordinators can approve. We should establish how much can be spent on this. </p> <p>RJ said something about finances\u2026 something something \u00a35600 a month Snackspace amounts need adjusting.  Purchase proposals were clarified. We\u2019ve agreed we should move money out of coop into Natwest. Some discussion on if we should open a savings account but then we could be liable for interest. Or we could open another account somewhere so we have redundancy. There should be some security mechanism for withdrawing large amounts.</p> <p>We are clear as a board on consumables. Some things should just be a purchase proposal.</p> <p>We should ask BD to pay someone to do electrical work and cert.</p> <p>For membership we\u2019ve more events happening now like DM Labs, Show and Tells and a potential space meeting. Ideas of a community board or information corner. The forum could be changed to show events near the top of the main page. Newsletter needs to happen. For tours we need more members and it's dwindling. Also concerns about quality. We could remove the 8:30 slot or change tours dates </p> <p>5 year plan Looking to get member buy in. 5 pillars of hackspace. - share docs with board - volunteer roles and culture change</p> <p>Peter\u2019s tool restrictions we need to decide on how to respond to Peter about wood working. We don't want to ban things, members should be able to ask. Areas should indicate what is and isn't allowed in the space.</p> <p>Safety around CNC machine build out. Things that need to be addressed are air lines compliance, call out critical infra, H&amp;S has been considered, Mark has checked it and a loan form has been signed. </p> <p>Storage JC has proposed an analogue system and it will force people to rotate out quarterly.</p> <p>Prusa XL is now live Area coordinator for 3d printers is a bigger problem than just getting a new area coordinator. Possibly gut the group, to keep more active people.</p> <p>Leak is still here and not going away. Northern should be starting work soon.</p> <p>Ask Mike if he wants to take over welding. Backup options are available.</p> <p>Get area coordinators to meet up and give more transparency to members. Reaffirm rules for area coordinator. Team level discussions.

Money boxes are now emptied more regularly to reduce risk when something does happen.</p> <p>Regarding cameras in the hacking areas, there are 4 main systems proposed: * Live strem that anyhone can view online: Concensus was \"Not happening fuck no\" * Live stream for members only: Not okay with everyone, would require veting to define who can/can't be a member * Swindon System - bot command that takes a snapshot - If implemented it would need to be geared to those who don't want to be on camera. * Other sort of sensing equipment: PIR/Radar - concensus on this was positive</p> <p>Reasons to have cameras are to see who is leaving a mess in the space, which would require someone to nanny cam it.  Reasons not to have cameras were varied from not wanting to be watched, issues with 16-18yr old memberships and extra legal issues, and we don't want to increase paperwork as it makes Bob sad and no-one wants a sad Bob. Further issues are that we can't deal with subject access requests if someone wants all images of them.</p> <p>Further suggestion was made for a dashcam style system in common areas, on a 48hr loop in the event that something does happen.</p> <p>No genuine reasons could be found to have cameras other than an \"it would be cool\" but would come at the cost of member comfort. </p>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2017-08-29/#cleaning","title":"Cleaning","text":"<p>Issues have arrised and the boxes of shame are BACK!

This is about 15% profit, which is far lower than the standard 35-50% profit on suggested RRP on almost all of the snacks and drinks we sell<ul> <li>To put this in perspective, that means with a max spend of \u00a3200 for a snackspace run, we make \u00a330 profit - if we took a taxi to the nearest Cash and Carry, it would cost us around \u00a36-8 each way, effectively halving profit (if the cost was claimed back)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Costs have risen, but we're selling things far cheaper than everywhere else, plus we haven't increased prices in a long time (if ever)</li> <li>The question is, how much profit do we want snackspace to bring in?<ul> <li>Profit merely goes back into space funds, allowing us to maintain equipment, buy consumables, save a war chest (for moving etc), and fund infrastructure projects</li> <li>Prices going up may stop people consuming a much, but even a significant raise in profit is unlikely to take us above many local places prices, especially prices in the city centre - the convenience means people are less likely to change buying habits too</li> <li>I (Chris/badspyro) suggest a modest rise to 25% profit, across every item evenly - for a fair number of items this will mean a small increase, and this would mean an increase over the same timescale (if everyone bought the same quantity) of \u00a3200 into the hackspace coffers. This is still far below market rate for all of the products, and will basically still be giving a decent 'discount' to members over the RRP.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2017-11-27/#proceedings","title":"Proceedings","text":""},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2017-11-27/#start","title":"Start","text":"<ul> <li>19:30 Meeting starts</li> </ul>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2017-11-27/#approval-of-previous-minutes","title":"Approval of previous minutes","text":"<p>Approved with one abstention</p>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2017-11-27/#reports-from-teams","title":"Reports from teams","text":"<ul> <li>Board: Reported that in October \u00a31550 in and 1500 out not including snackspace.

From how the benches are currently wired, we should be able to use 100mm by 100mm emergency stops rated at 10 amps (e.g. these http://uk.farnell.com/siemens/3su1801-0na00-2ac2/emergency-stop-sw-spst-nc-500v/dp/2695606). I'm happy to do what ever planning etc is needed, but I'm not an electrician so someone else would need to do the actual install.</li> <li>'''Isolator for Wood Lathe''' Given the risk profile of the wood lathe, before it is put live could we put the power supply through an isolator (e.g. this: http://uk.farnell.com/imo-precision-controls/pe69-3020/isolator-encl-ip65-3pole/dp/9940863) that can be locked off with a combination lock? People would only be given the code to the combination lock once they were fully inducted. </li> <li>'''Emergency Stops in Other Areas''' We might want to look at other places where emergency stops would be useful - e.g. one for electronics bench and a couple in weldy grindy?</li> <li> <p>'''Portable Appliance Testing''' Is there anybody in the space (or do who we know anyone) who could lend us a calibrated PAT machine? If so, could they provide the training needed for the space to use it over a weekend so that we can PAT everything with a plug (that needs it)?</p> </li> <li> <p>When large changes, such as areas of the hackspace and tools/equipment movement need to be discussed, such as the move of craft space, it should be submitted to the agenda to allow members who cannot be at the MMMM to give input (and not brought forward in AOB or as part of another point without that point being fleshed out in the agenda). This should allow members to contribute even if they can't be at meetings, and give insight into discussions such as the reason for the location of tools, requirements for specific workspaces, etc. Without this, a MMMM could push through decisions from a few people without the ability for other members to contribute. It could also mean that work that has been done in a well meaning way could have to be repeatedly modified due to unintended consequences that could have been mitigated with other members input.</p> </li> <li> <p>Craft area and plastic forming</p> </li> <li>Crafts moved to centre of the hackspace for better accessibility, old area is now plastic forming area<ul> <li>The new positioning of the craft area has a number of significant problems</li> <li>The increase in dust around the sewing machines is significant<ul> <li>This was a significant factor in moving these machines far away. This may well reduce the lifespan of the sewing machines and increase their need to be sent out for maintenance. While the dust covers Lucy made for them work fairly well, they aren't designed to deal with this level of dust.</li> <li>Any fabric projects will require the craft desk to be wiped down before use, whereas the desk in the corner stayed relatively dust controlled.</li> <li>Things like knitting wool, thread, etc, are dust sensitive and nearly impossible to safely wash before they are made into a project. Putting these in such a dusty area of the space could loose us a fair amount of bought or donated consumables on a regular basis.</li> <li>The craft area is now far away from the storage of items used for crafting - like the leather, fabric, paints, etc, and many of these can't be easily moved to the area without risking them with lots of dust.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2018-01-22/#proceedings","title":"Proceedings","text":""},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2018-01-22/#start","title":"Start","text":"<ul> <li>19:30:00 Meeting starts</li> <li>19:30:07 Iain's phone rings</li> <li>19:30:24 Meeting adjourned as food order has arrived with impeccable timing</li> <li>Due to the quantity of text in the agenda, printouts were provided for members to view at their own leisure to save the Chair's voice.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2018-01-22/#approval-of-previous-minutes","title":"Approval of previous minutes","text":"<p>Approved.</p>"},{"location":"governance/general_meetings/MMMMM/2018-01-22/#reports-from-teams","title":"Reports from teams","text":"<ul> <li>Board: Not a positive gain of members in December, financially main losses were snackspace and the skip.

The Y2 limit switch does not interact with the machine in any way except during homing. It is used to autosquare should the previous user have knocked alignment. </li> <li>G59.3 is at X0Y498. This is the toolsetter location and is persistent. You are free to use G54-G59 for any WCS you desire. Tool length is variable, and toolsetting using M6 always retracts fully before setting to give maximum flexibility. You can reference TLS/TLO with the 3D probe connected, and running M6T99 and then cycle start. This will set your reference, ready for M6 in gcode. This will be covered in induction. Once you have set TLO you are free to use the probe to set your WCS.</li> <li>Recommended feed in Aluminium and wood is between 3500 and 6000 mm/min, with the sweet spot around 4500.

M6 tells the machine it's a \"toolchange\" and T99 means tool number 99, which we have assigned to the 3d probe. It then enables the protection routines automatically.</p> <p>Spindle Warmup:</p> <p>M3 - This instructs the machine to turn on the spindle. Sometimes you will want to warm it up before machining. M3 means \"turn on and rotate clockwise. You can similarly use M4 for counterclockwise.</p> <p>S15000 - This is used in conjunction with M3/M4 and instructs the spindle speed. In this case, you would set the speed to 15000RPM. An example command would be M3S20000, which would instruct the spindle to rotate clockwise at 20000RPM.</p> <p>Jogging:</p> <p>G0 - This instructs the machine to move at 'rapid' or 'maximum' speed. It is used in conjunction with the commands below to move the machine to particular coordinates.</p> <p>G1 - This instructs the machine to move at a set speed, in conjunction with the F commands below.</p> <p>F1000 - This sets the feed rate, for a G1 command. </p> <p>X5Y5Z-5 - This instructs the machine to move to the following coordinates. It is used in conjunction with G0 or G1. </p> <p>An example of these commands together are as follows: To move to machine to x400y400z-100 at a feed rate of 4000, we would type G1F4000X400Y400Z-100. To move it at max speed, we would simply type G0X400Y400Z-100</p>"},{"location":"workshop_info/cnc/chunky_cnc/reference_terms/#common-terms-reference","title":"Common terms reference:","text":"<p>TLO - Tool Length Offset.

You don't want your endmill getting stuck!</p> <p>Wood:</p> <p>4mm, 6mm endmills Compression Bit Or 1F Use vacuum</p> <p>The basic wood strategy is high speed and feed with an approximate 5mm stepdown. If using a 1f 4mm you may want to limit your stepdown to 2mm or so. Always use the vacuum with wood. Our biggest issue is burning and scorching, so our aim is to feed fast enough to avoid this. Reducing speed can help reduce burn with larger endmills. Compression endmills are stronger [less likely to snap]</p> <p>Always run at 24,000 rpm. You will run around 3000-5000mm/min on most woods with these endmills.  We suggest 4500mm/min to start. Pockets with a 4mm can be slower, all the way down to 1300mm/min. Start around 2000mm/min. Make sure your endmill is up to speed before entering the stock.</p> <p>An 8mm endmill should be run around 15,000-18,000 rpm at 4500mm/min and 5-8mm stepdown. You may experience a lot of tearout here, so use for rough fast material removal. You can run anything up to a 1/2\" compression bit.</p> <p>When planing, using the 45mm planing bit, use a 0.5mm stepdown, an RPM of 16,000, and a speed not slower than 3000 mm/min. Always practice before planing a large bit. </p> <p>If you need to use an endmill smaller than 4mm, be careful. Wood is generally quite forgiving but you can always snap bits. The number one consideration is to ensure you are running at 24,000rpm. You will want to run slower too, and generally remove most material with a larger endmill before stepping down. </p> <p>Aluminium</p> <p>4mm, 6mm, 8mm endmills 1F (3f for finishing) Use Collet fan, air blast, and IPA.</p> <p>Aluminium milling is a delicate balance between running fast enough not to chipweld, and slow enough not to exert enough pressure on the endmill to snap it. This is especially important as 1f are not the most rigid. The following speeds are a good starter guide.</p> <p>4mm and 6mm endmills should be run at 24,000rpm. A 4mm endmill should be run at 2000 mm/min, whereas a 6mm endmill can run up to 4500 mm/min. Stepdown can be up to 3 or even 4mm for a 6mm, but start with a 1.5mm stepdown and see how you go. Apply IPA once in a while, and ensure chips are being cleared efficiently. A finishing pass can run as slow as 1000 mm/min</p> <p>8mm endmills can be run at 21,000rpm, and up to a 8mm stepdown depending on speed. A 2.5-3mm stepdown at 4000 mm/min is a good start for material removal.</p> <p>Only run 3f endmills for finishing, ensuring you are not removing a lot of material. If chips get gunked in channels, the endmills will snap.</p>"},{"location":"workshop_info/electronics/equipment/reflow_oven/","title":"Reflow Oven","text":""},{"location":"workshop_info/electronics/equipment/reflow_oven/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<ul> <li>The reflow oven is a Puhui T-962</li> <li>http://www.tech168.cn</li> <li>https://www.instructables.com/id/Guide-to-the-T-962A-Reflow-Oven/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workshop_info/electronics/equipment/reflow_oven/#operation","title":"Operation","text":"<p>Note when plugging in the oven be aware that it uses around 6A so make sure it's not a socket strip with heaters plugged into</p> <ul> <li>First turn on the oven using the Red switch at the back</li> </ul> <p>Next we're going to select the Wave2 profile</p> <ul> <li>Press F3 for Temp Wave Select</li> <li>On the wave selection screen, press F1 to select Wave2</li> <li>Press F4 for Ok to select the wave</li> <li>If you accidently press F4 more than once it can sometimes     toggle the display afterwards into Chinese mode, just press F4 in     the main menu again to toggle back to English</li> </ul> <p>Next to start the oven</p> <ul> <li>Press F1 to start the oven at the selected wave</li> <li>If you want to Abort / Stop the oven just hit S</li> </ul> <p>Once the oven beeps this is an indication that it's finished, press the S button to stop the beeping</p> <p>Finally once finished, wait for things to cool down and remember to Turn off the oven when finished</p> <p>Category:Equipment Category:Team Electronics Category:Electrospace</p>"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/","title":"Consumables (metal)","text":""},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/#metalwork-consumables","title":"Metalwork Consumables","text":"Item Preferred Supplier Notes Screwdriver bits Screwdrivers Screwdriver Magnetic Coupler Thing Mitre Saw Blades Green Bandsaw Blades 4 x 36 Sanding Belt Polishing Compound Whet Stone Oil Stone Plane Blades Nail gun nails FretSaw/Scroll Blades Planner Thickneer Blades Chisles Wood Drill Bits Holes Saws Forsner Bits Countersinks Steel Wool Red Bandsaw Blades 3rd Sheet Sandpaper Dremels (And Various Bits) Wood Screws Nails Sockets Table Saw Blades IPA 5L ACETONE 5L Deionised Water (5L) WD40 (5L) Q10 PENETRATING OIL White Spirit (2L) 10 Inch Saws Other Saws Hacksaw Blades 12 Inch Junior Hacksaw Blades Coping Saw Blades"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/#lathes","title":"Lathes","text":"Item Preferred Supplier Notes Bearing Oil (Myford) https://www.myford.co.uk/acatalog/VG32-LUBRICATING-OIL---ESSO-NUTO-32---1-LITRE-662.html VG32 LUBRICATING OIL - ESSO NUTO 32 Way Oil https://www.lubefinder.com/mobil-vactra-oil-no-2.html Mobil Vactra Oil No.2 Gear/rack grease https://www.cromwell.co.uk/shop/lubricants-and-chemicals/greases/mts-1000-grease-500g/p/ROC7706227K Rocol MTS 1000 Insert - General Insert - Threading"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/#mill","title":"Mill","text":"Item Preferred Supplier Notes Test"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/#drills","title":"Drills","text":"Item Preferred Supplier Notes Test"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/#hand-tools","title":"Hand Tools","text":"Item Preferred Supplier Notes Hack Saw Blade"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/consumables_%28metal%29/#health-safety","title":"Health &amp; Safety","text":"Item Preferred Supplier Notes Googles"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/equipment/air_compressor/","title":"Mobile Compressor","text":"<p>We have two air compressors at the Hackspace, a large fixed 150L and a smaller 50L portable one</p> <p>This 50l compressor runs at 8bar, and can run a variety of tools.</p>"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/equipment/air_compressor/#documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>Sealey Compressor Manual</p> <p>Sealey Compressor Parts List</p>"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/equipment/air_compressor/#risk-assessments","title":"Risk Assessments","text":"<p>Air Compressor Risk Assessment</p> <p>Category:Equipment Category:Stubs</p>"},{"location":"workshop_info/metalwork/equipment/metal_bandsaw/","title":"Metal Bandsaw","text":"<p>The bandsaw is a Clarke CBS45M, a convertable horizontal / vertical bandsaw, designed for cutting metal bar, rod and tube down to length.
